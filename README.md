## Get this to work
1. Make sure the ```sty``` Python library is on your system. 
2. Place the Python file and the shell script somewhere on your system and modify the path in the shell script.
3. A nice idea is to add a keyboard shortcut or a graphical starter. For the latter you can use the icons in this repository.
